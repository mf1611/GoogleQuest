       "      <td>After playing around with macro photography on-the-cheap (read: reversed lens, rev. lens mounted on a straight lens, passive extension tubes), I would like to get further with this. The problems with the techniques I used is that focus is manual and aperture control is problematic at best. This limited my setup to still subjects (read: dead insects) Now, as spring is approaching, I want to be able to shoot live insects. I believe that for this, autofocus and settable aperture will be of great help.\\n\\nSo, one obvious but expensive option is a macro lens (say, EF 100mm Macro) However, I am not really interested in yet another prime lens. An alternative is the electrical extension tubes.\\n\\nExcept for maximum focusing distance, what am I losing when using tubes (coupled with a fine lens, say EF70-200/2.8) instead of a macro lens?\\n</td>\n",

Increasing that distance from the end of the lens to the sensor can cut your light several stops.  Combined with the fact that you'll usually shoot stopped down - expect to need to increase your ISO considerably.\\n\\nThe fact the macro's are usually considered very very sharp, although I believe that 70-200mm 2.8 is supposed to be quite sharp.\\n\\nThe ultra low distortion typical of many macros.\\n\\nI wouldn't worry too much about the bokeh since the DOF will still be quite limited.\\n\\nCoupled on my 50mm, a full 60mm'ish extension tube results in a DOF of about a couple inches in front of the lens.  On my 70-300, its probably around 2-3 feet in front of the lens to about a foot in front of the lens.\\n</td>\n",

Per Google a metroplex is \" a very large metropolitan area, especially one that is an aggregation of two or more cities\".  A city downtown and sprawl downtown would tend to have similar densities, but for some reason the sprawl (which includes suburbs?) has a higher spam zone noise rating (p 231).  Similarly, I'd think of a downtown as being more dense and noisy (e.g. Office buildings and street vendors) than a commercial district, e.g. an outdoor mall.

The saw blade simply cuts all of the leads almost flush with the board surface.  \\n\\nThis system is suited for boards of all sizes but especially for those boards larger than can be handled easily to be sanded with the belt sander.\\n\\nAlso note that these techniques are suitable only for PC boards with plated-through holes.  \\n</td>\n",

       "0  After playing around with macro photography on-the-cheap (read: reversed lens, rev. lens mounted on a straight lens, passive extension tubes), I would like to get further with this. The problems with the techniques I used is that focus is manual and aperture control is problematic at best. This limited my setup to still subjects (read: dead insects) Now, as spring is approaching, I want to be able to shoot live insects. I believe that for this, autofocus and settable aperture will be of great help.\\n\\nSo, one obvious but expensive option is a macro lens (say, EF 100mm Macro) However, I am not really interested in yet another prime lens. An alternative is the electrical extension tubes.\\n\\nExcept for maximum focusing distance, what am I losing when using tubes (coupled with a fine lens, say EF70-200/2.8) instead of a macro lens?\\n   \n",

Per Google a metroplex is \" a very large metropolitan area, especially one that is an aggregation of two or more cities\".  A city downtown and sprawl downtown would tend to have similar densities, but for some reason the sprawl (which includes suburbs?) has a higher spam zone noise rating (p 231).  Similarly, I'd think of a downtown as being more dense and noisy (e.g. Office buildings and street vendors) than a commercial district, e.g. an outdoor mall.  The noise ratings make me think that I am thinking about this incorrectly. What is a better way of thinking of them?\\n                                                    \n",

Assuming a standard 0.062\" thickness FR4 board, how deep do I need to make the grooves in the plastic block?

Increasing that distance from the end of the lens to the sensor can cut your light several stops.  Combined with the fact that you'll usually shoot stopped down - expect to need to increase your ISO considerably.\\n\\nThe fact the macro's are usually considered very very sharp, although I believe that 70-200mm 2.8 is supposed to be quite sharp.\\n\\nThe ultra low distortion typical of many macros.\\n\\nI wouldn't worry too much about the bokeh since the DOF will still be quite limited.\\n\\nCoupled on my 50mm, a full 60mm'ish extension tube results in a DOF of about a couple inches in front of the lens.  On my 70-300, its probably around 2-3 feet in front of the lens to about a foot in front of the lens.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

A smaller city with less urban/suburban territory surrounding it ostensibly wouldn't have as much spam.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "2  Do you even need grooves?  We make several products using through-hole components that are intended to mount using VHB double-sided foam tape.  The boards are 0.062\" thick double-sided with PTH and we use a table-top vertical belt sander to bring the component leads almost flush with the solder mask.  In other words, the solder mask isn't touched by the sand paper but the leads are all sanded flat and sitting just proud of the solder mask.\\n\\nThis works well for small boards.\\n\\nFor what it's worth, there are commercial machines available that use a rotary saw blade to do the same thing.  The board is held horizontal in a mounting / clamping system on the base and the saw motor is vertical on a sliding X-Y mechanism.  The saw blade simply cuts all of the leads almost flush with the board surface.  \\n\\nThis system is suited for boards of all sizes but especially for those boards larger than can be handled easily to be sanded with the belt sander.\\n\\nAlso note that these techniques are suitable only for PC boards with plated-through holes.  \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

However, I've always just left them lying around. This doesn't seem to have any obvious consequences.\\n\\nDo they upset prisoners or staff (e.g. increasing the danger level beyond what death normally does)? Make them sick? Slow down pathing? Is this something that's not implemented yet or is leaving dead bodies all over the place meant to be completely fine?\\n\\nThe wiki's pages for Death and Morgue don't shed any light on this. All I'm finding is the how of getting rid of corpses/glitches related to it but not why it matters in the first place. All I've seen that's related is that apparently prisoners can loot guard corpses for keys, but there's no obvious consequences for prisoner corpses which are what I tend to end up with.\\n\\nSo why not just leave them in the corridors?\\n</td>\n",

Actually the crosshair never moves that high so there tends to be a good amount of additional upward deviation of single shots fired.\\n\\nBut when single-shooting during the minor tilts the marks seemed to end up exactly at the location of the crosshair.\\n\\nNow, when switching to spraying while being shot this pattern emerged.

If you have another USB drive I recommend using rsync.  I use the following command to backup one external hard drive to a 2nd device on my Pi where /media/USBHDD1 is the mount point of the 1st drive and /media/USBHDD2 is the mount point of the 2nd drive.  rsync can recover from an interrupted copy in case your drive disappears while performing the copy.  You should be able to just power cycle failed drive and perform the copy command again.  rsync should pick up where it left off.\\n\\nrsync -av --delete /media/USBHDD1/* /media/USBHDD2/\\n\\n</td>\n",

       "0  I see questions/information online about how to get rid of corpses but I'm not sure what the consequences to having them lying around are.\\n\\nI know that I can use a morgue to store them and that they will eventually be taken away in a hearse. However, I've always just left them lying around. This doesn't seem to have any obvious consequences.\\n\\nDo they upset prisoners or staff (e.g. increasing the danger level beyond what death normally does)? Make them sick? Slow down pathing? Is this something that's not implemented yet or is leaving dead bodies all over the place meant to be completely fine?\\n\\nThe wiki's pages for Death and Morgue don't shed any light on this. All I'm finding is the how of getting rid of corpses/glitches related to it but not why it matters in the first place. All I've seen that's related is that apparently prisoners can loot guard corpses for keys, but there's no obvious consequences for prisoner corpses which are what I tend to end up with.\\n\\nSo why not just leave them in the corridors?\\n

       "2  To experiment I started a bot game, toggled invincibility and let the bots attack me. There were two clear hit effects: a major one that tilts view up a lot and sideways and a minor one that only tilts it up.\\n\\nSo I tried releasing single shots exactly at the tilts: during a major one a single bullet ended up here (slightly covered by text). Actually the crosshair never moves that high so there tends to be a good amount of additional upward deviation of single shots fired.\\n\\nBut when single-shooting during the minor tilts the marks seemed to end up exactly at the location of the crosshair.\\n\\nNow, when switching to spraying while being shot this pattern emerged. This was mostly caused by the minor tilts and, I guess, \"standard recoil\". Occasionally a major tilt caused a single bullet to lie severly outside of the depicted cone.\\n

       "3  I have used my Raspberry Pi as a torrent-server for quite a while now. My Western Digital \"My Passport-Ultra\" external HDD and Transmission running on RPi has worked flawlessly for more than a year. Suddenly last week my setup started producing I/O errors and now when I SSH into my RPi I cant find the HDD folder. \\n\\nI have not changed anything with my RPi or the torrent-server setup since I set it up.\\n\\nCan someone help me find a solution to my problem?\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nThe external HHD works fine the first 20 minutes or so, and then Transmisson gives me \"Error: Input/output

Does the drive behave like this on a different computer system?\\n\\nAgain, I strongly recommend that you backup any irreplaceable data on this drive before it fails completely.  If you have another USB drive I recommend using rsync.  I use the following command to backup one external hard drive to a 2nd device on my Pi where /media/USBHDD1 is the mount point of the 1st drive and /media/USBHDD2 is the mount point of the 2nd drive.  rsync can recover from an interrupted copy in case your drive disappears while performing the copy.

So no worries, you will be fine.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
